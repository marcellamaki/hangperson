To start the game, open your terminal and type in bin/run.

The hangperson game has a database built into the app with words and phrases. There are five categories, each of them containing words and phrases.


To begin the game, the application will ask the user for his or her name. Then, the user will be prompted to select one of five categories. The application then chooses a random word or phrase from that category. The application will display underscores for each letter in the word or phrase. The application will then prompt the user to guess a letter.

After each user letter or solve input, the user will see three things on the display: the hangperson, the incorrect guesses, and the puzzle. If the user guesses a letter which is not contained in the puzzle, the guessed letter will be stored under incorrect guesses. The user will also get one strike for each incorrect letter guessed, including if the user guesses the same incorrect letter multiple times. Each strike will add one part to the hangperson body. If the user enters a letter that is contained in the puzzle, the application will update the puzzle to reflect the placement of the correct letter. The hangperson and the incorrect guesses will also be displayed, but will not be changed.


Rules of the game:

The user has six strikes before the game ends, resulting in a loss for the user. If the user successfully guesses each letter, or successfully "solves", then the game ends, resulting in a win for the user.

If at any any point the user wants to solve the game, he or she can enter the entire word or phrase at one time. If the guess is correct, the game ends, resulting in a win for the user. If the guess is incorrect, the game ends, resulting in a loss for the user.


<!-- The user can type in "help" at any time, which will display the following commands that are available to him or her. The user can enter any of these commands at any time.
record - your win/loss history
exit - leave the game, which will result in a loss  // MENU TO COME --># hangperson
